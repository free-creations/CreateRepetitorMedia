    <p>This package provides a number of utilities that can be used to
      clean and tidy up a Midi Sequence.</p>
    <p>The Midi File Specification has grown over time, so that now
      it has become sometimes inconsistent allowing features that are
      quite unfunctional to be handled in a sequencer. The utilities 
      provided in this package help to overcome these problems
      by reordering the events in a Mid-sequence without changing
      how the sequence will sound.</p>
    <p>
      <code>
        * @TODO 
        * 1) eliminate empty tracks (tracks with no MIDI events)
        * 2) search for real volume events and put them at the start
        * 3) change inter-notes volume events to expression events
        * 4) add option to change volume into key-velocity
        * 5) multiport songs
        * 6) option to shorten a sequence
      </code></p>
